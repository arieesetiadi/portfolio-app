                                        more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything
                                        counts as out of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable
                                        things about these lockdown days that are worth photographing now so
                                        we can remember them when it is all over.</p>
                                    <p>Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the
                                        sense of historical pictures from before the invention of the
                                        motorcar. Other things that are different at the moment will be
                                        queues to get into stores and the lines marked out on the floor to
                                        show how far apart we should be.</p>

                                        <p>Most photographers find it hard to see interesting pictures in
                                            places in which they are most familiar. A trip somewhere new
                                            seems always exactly what our photography needed, as shooting
                                            away from home consistently inspires us to new artistic heights.

                                    <p>Pretend everything is new and that you haven’t seen it before, and
                                        then you will be free to notice the leading lines, the places where
                                        one edge meets another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the
                                        ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when the light is on
                                        or off.</p>
                                    <p>The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time
                                        to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different
                                        angles, with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move
                                        to the left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house
                                        again.</p>

                                        normally would, doesn’t mean we have to stop taking pictures.
                                        There’s still plenty you can do, provided you're prepared to use
